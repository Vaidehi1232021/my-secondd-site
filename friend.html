               <p>Friendship Day is the day of celebrating the bond of friendship which you share with your friends.
                  It's the day when you take pledge to be by your friend's side no matter what happens and be the 
                  guiding light to your friend. It's the day when friends erase all differences and hope for a new 
                  start and a new beginning. Finally it's the day when you pray for your beloved friend's wellbeing 
                  and wish that your friendship remain strong, till eternity!.
                  your lovely friends.
